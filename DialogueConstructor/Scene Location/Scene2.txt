[Narrator]
The lobby is two-stories high. A massive WODA Corp logo takes up the wall behind the front desk. You glance at the receptionist and she smiles – a strange smile, like an involuntary reaction, almost artificial.

[Dialogue]
Here comes the big man. Impeccable in a tailored suit, Mr. Avery strides right at you, ready for a handshake. You rise.
C_Mr. Avery: “Hey, you look [C2_1]”
You shake his hand sturdily. He exhibits an impossibly white smile… And sustains it for an unnaturally long time.
He shows you around the office floor. It’s not typical for the boss to tour new employees – he ensures you know that – but he wants you to feel welcome.  
You step into the break room. Between comfy chairs and the kitchen counter are refrigerators filled to the brim with WODA Water bottles. 
C_Mr. Avery: “We take our employees' well-being seriously!”
He points to the vending machines. Instead of the usual chip bags and candy, you see a selection of individually wrapped fruit: apples, bananas, berries – each in their own little plastic wrap. 
He offers that artificial smile again. 
C_Mr. Avery: “Let me show you to your desk.”

—------ (a long break between this and the next line)

You sit at the desk, peeking out the window to your left. The cooling system feels so refreshing. Looking down at the people on the street in their tank tops and shorts, you can hardly believe you’re in the same block.
Mr. Avery is gone to deal with more important things. A long list of tasks await you. You browse through them still trying to make sense of the platform and your new email. The inbox is already full.  
RIIIING. You answer the desk phone. There is an urgent request to order more office paper. 
[\Narrator]

[Choice]
You check your email: WODA Corp has been using mostly bleached white, silky quality paper. There were a few purchases of recycled paper a few months ago, but not recently. There is a small price difference, but the order will be big.

[Dialogue]
Your request is submitted. You hope you’ve made the right choice. 
In the break room, you get some WODA water and an apple. You break the plastic wrap to find the most lustrous red apple you've ever laid your eyes on.
C_Cory: “Are you the new assistant manager?”
You turn around to see a jovial woman stroking her pregnant belly. You nod and introduce yourself. 
C_Cory: “Cory, from accounting.”
She smiles - the first genuine smile you’ve seen today. She asks how the work is going, offers to help you if you need anything. 
At the end of the day you make a point to stop by her desk to wish her a good evening. You walk down the hall, where Cory said her desk was…
A massive safety vault catches your attention immediately. It’s so out of place, as if you had suddenly turned the corner into a bank. It takes a while to notice Cory, by her desk, right next to the huge safe door. 
You ask her what that is. She smiles and shrugs.
