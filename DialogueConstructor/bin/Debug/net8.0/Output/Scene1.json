It's a message from Leslie. And a photo.\nLeslie stands in the center of a small village, surrounded by rainforest. The roofs of the houses have given in. The water reaches Leslie's ankle. The message below reads \"These floods are happening more and more.\"\nYou text back, worried. But it doesn't go through. Leslie is probably out of reach again. It's been like this for months.\nLeslie is the most admirable person you know... to risk yourself like that, that's something you could never do.\nBut you are doing what you can.

More than suitable; you are slightly under qualified to be starting in this position.\nYou know why you got it - family ties go a long way. But that doesn't matter now.\nThis is WODA Corp, one of the largest companies in the world. Better yet, they are sustainable! You've read about their efforts to offset carbon, their research on biodegradable plastics... This is gonna be good.\nYou stare at the two outfits lying on the bed. One is business casual, light fabrics, appropriate for a day like today. The other is WODA attire, heavier but much more formal - and you know they have a powerful cooling system, so you will be fine.\n"}],"consequences":[]},{"ID":"C1_2","ChoiceText":"It's time to get ready.","Options":[{"option_ID":1,"option_text":"\"Pick the business casual outfit.\"","karma_value":0},{"option_ID":2,"option_text":"\"Pick WODA attire.\"","karma_value":0}]},{"ID":0,"text":[{"character":{"Name":"Narrator","ID":"C_NAR"},"text":"You look confident.
