But that doesn't matter now.\nThis is WODA Corp, one of the largest companies in the world. Better yet, they are sustainable! You've read about their efforts to offset carbon, their research on biodegradable plastics... This is gonna be good.\nYou stare at the two outfits lying on the bed. One is business casual, light fabrics, appropriate for a day like today. The other is WODA attire, heavier but much more formal - and you know they have a powerful cooling system, so you will be fine.\n"}],"consequences":[],"DiagType":"Dialogue"},{"ID":"C1_2","ChoiceText":"It's time to get ready.","Options":[{"option_ID":1,"option_text":"\"Pick the business casual outfit.\"","karma_value":0},{"option_ID":2,"option_text":"\"Pick WODA attire.\"","karma_value":0}],"DiagType":"Choice"},{"ID":0,"text":[{"character":{"Name":"Narrator","ID":"C_NAR"},"text":"You look confident.
