What can you do?
The heat is unbearable today. It's too early in the morning to be this warm.
It's been like this for a while and there is no air conditioning in your house. You share it with eco-conscious people, living sustainably, refusing to throw more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere just for personal comfort. It's hard to live by their standards sometimes, but you know they are right. 
But it is so hot today. What can you do?

[Narrator]
There is a notification on your phone. It's a message from Leslie. And a photo. 
Leslie stands in the center of a small village, surrounded by rainforest. The roofs of the houses have given in. The water reaches Leslie's ankle. The message below reads "These floods are happening more and more."
You text back, worried. But it doesn't go through. Leslie is probably out of reach again. It's been like this for months. 
Leslie is the most admirable person you know... to risk yourself like that, that's something you could never do. 
But you are doing what you can. And today, things will change.

After months of fruitless interviews and unpaid internship offers, you finally managed to find something suitable. More than suitable; you are slightly under qualified to be starting in this position. 
You know why you got it - family ties go a long way. But that doesn't matter now.  
This is WODA Corp, one of the largest companies in the world. Better yet, they are sustainable! You've read about their efforts to offset carbon, their research on biodegradable plastics... This is gonna be good. 
You stare at the two outfits lying on the bed. One is business casual, light fabrics, appropriate for a day like today. The other is WODA attire, heavier but much more formal - and you know they have a powerful cooling system, so you will be fine.

You look confident. Time to join your housemates for breakfast and tell them about the new job. You've kept it a secret so far (no jinxing it!) but you think they will be pretty pleased.
